# Storage Provider Mentorship Grants
## About
Our mission is to help businesses get started on their journey as storage providers as smoothly and efficiently as possible. To accomplish this goal, we have established a grant program to ease SPs through the onboarding process via 1:1 consulting sessions and technical support with trusted ecosystem partners who are proven, dedicated, and technically adept SPs themselves. 

Please see below for our current list of SP consulting partners, as well as the various consulting packages that are available to qualified storage providers. Make sure to continue to check back at this page, as more consultants and options will become available over time.

## Overview of Grant Offerings
The first mentorship grant package will provide access to a consulting package that will help answer the most basic questions about becoming an SP. Our trusted and knowledgeable consultants will walk you through the ROI of being an SP, hardware considerations, and other technical topics. Through mid-June, this grant will fully subsidize 10 hours of consulting for only the first 10 qualified candidates. This package is valued at roughly $4,000 (USD) and is **only available for a limited time**.

In the future, up to 50% of consulting hours will be subsidized for qualified candidates. More details regarding these consulting packages will be released in the near future. 

## Qualified Candidates 
We are looking for potential Storage Providers from all backgrounds and regions, however candidates will *not* be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis. Candidates will first submit an application that will provide our consultants with more information about their backgrounds and end goals. Applicable candidates will then be granted a one-hour check-in session where our consultants will determine whether one of their consulting packages will be an appropriate fit. If our consultants deem appropriate, they will then approve candidates for a full consulting package.

_Note: Once approved for consulting services and offered the grant package, candidates have seven (7) days to sign the contract agreement with the consultant. Demand is expected to be high, so your cooperation in onboarding quickly and efficiently will be very much appreciated. Lastly, qualified candidates will only be eligible to receive one fully-subsidized 10 hour package -- additional packages will be made available to purchase at a later date._
