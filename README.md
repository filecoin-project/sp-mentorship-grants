# Storage Provider Mentorship Grants
## About
Our mission is to help businesses get started on their journey as storage providers as smoothly and efficiently as possible. To accomplish this goal, we have established a grant program to help ease SPs through the onboarding process via 1:1 consulting sessions with trusted ecosystem partners. 
Please see below for our current list of SP partners who will be providing the consulting hours, as well as the various consulting packages that are available to storage providers. Please continue to check back at this link, as more packages will become available over time.

## Overview of Grant Offerings
The first mentorship grant will provide access to a consulting package that can help answer the most basic questions about becoming an SP. Our trusted and knowledgeable consultants will walk you through the ROI of being an SP, hardware considerations based on end goals, and other technical topics. For a limited time through mid-June, this grant subsidizes 10 full hours of SP consulting for the first 10 qualified candidates. This package is valued at roughly $4,000 (USD).

_Note: Once offered the grant, candidates have seven (7) days to sign the contract agreement approving the consulting package. Demand is expected to be high, so your cooperation in onboarding quickly and efficiently will be much appreciated._
