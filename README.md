# Storage Provider Mentorship Grants
## About
Our mission is to support businesses getting started on their journey as storage providers as smoothly and efficiently as possible. To accomplish this goal, we have established a grant program to ease Storage Providers (SPs) through the onboarding process via in person consulting and technical support from trusted ecosystem partners who are proven, dedicated, and technically adept SPs themselves. 

Below you will find our current list of SP consulting partners, as well as the various grant offerings that are available to qualified Storage Providers. Make sure to continue to check back at this page, as more consultants and options will become available over time. You are also encouraged to [become a member of the Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) and join [#fil-sp-mentorship-grants](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03C86E3WU8) for instant updates.

## Overview of Grant Offerings
Our various mentorship grant packages will provide access to consulting that can help answer the most basic questions about becoming an SP. Our trusted and knowledgeable consultants will walk you through the considerations of calculating the potential ROI of being an SP, hardware considerations, and other technical topics. To learn more about the consulting packages available for SPs, please visit the websites of our consulting partners, listed in the above section. 

Currently, up to 50% of consulting hours will be subsidized for qualified candidates, essentially making all consulting packages 50% off for qualified grant recipients. 

## Qualified Candidates 
We are looking for potential Storage Providers from all backgrounds and regions, however candidates will *not* be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis. Candidates will first submit an application that will provide our consultants with more information about their backgrounds and end goals. Applicable candidates will then be granted a one-hour check-in session where our consultants will determine whether one of their consulting packages will be an appropriate fit. Our consultants will help applying for the grant and if deemed appropriate, the FSPM Grants Team will approve the candidates.

_Note: Once approved for subsidized consulting services, offered the granted hours, candidates have seven working (7) days to sign the consulting agreement with the consultant. Demand is expected to be high, so your cooperation in onboarding quickly and efficiently will be very much appreciated. Lastly, you can find more information about availability and the exact terms of the offered consulting packages on the consultants website_
