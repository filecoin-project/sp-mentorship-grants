# Storage Provider Mentorship Grants
## About
Our mission is to support businesses getting started on their journey as storage providers as smoothly and efficiently as possible. To accomplish this goal, we have established a grant program to ease Storage Providers (SPs) through the onboarding process via in person consulting and technical support from trusted ecosystem partners who are proven, dedicated, and technically adept SPs themselves. 

Below you will find our current list of SP consulting partners, as well as the various grant offerings that are available to qualified Storage Providers. Make sure to continue to check back at this page, as more consultants and options will become available over time. You are also encouraged to [become a member of the Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) and join [#fil-sp-mentorship-grants](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C03C86E3WU8) for instant updates.

## NOTICE
